# Automated Test Equipment
This project illustrates the building and testing of an Automated Test System Prototype which is effective in replacing the human factor and in increasing the efficiency in production.

The software procedure involves the usage of LabView based on visual programming. The idea was to create an easy-to-understand Graphical User Interface able to control the prototype System and to simulate the automation process, by using the logic of code blocks implemented in a LabView program.

The result of this project can be seen in the below video:
